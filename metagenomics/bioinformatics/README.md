Here the codes used to run the scripts for bio-informatics of metagenomics are reported.
Please note that many of the tools were run through slurm jobs


Numbers indicate the order for the code to run. 
I apologize in case the code is not perfect (especially the R codes where not entirely "cleaned")/
Please contact me for clarifications.
